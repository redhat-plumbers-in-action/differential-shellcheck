inputs:
  triggering-event:
    description: The name of the event that triggered the workflow run. Supported values are (pull_request | push | manual).
    required: false
    default: ${{ github.event_name }}

  base:
    description: Hash of base commit. This input is used when triggering-event is set to "manual".
    required: false
    default: ""
  head:
    description: Hash of head commit. This input is used when triggering-event is set to "manual".
    required: false
    default: ""

  pull-request-base:
    description: Hash of top commit on base branch. This input is used when triggering-event is set to "pull_request".
    required: false
    default: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
  pull-request-head:
    description: Hash of latest commit in Pull Request. This input is used when triggering-event is set to "pull_request".
    required: false
    default: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

  push-event-base:
    description: Hash of the last commit before push. This input is used when triggering-event is set to "push".
    required: false
    default: ${{ github.event.before }}
  push-event-head:
    description: Hash of the last commit after push. This input is used when triggering-event is set to "push".
    required: false
    default: ${{ github.event.after }}

  diff-scan:
    description: Input allowing to request specific type of scan. Input is taken into consideration only if `triggering-event` is set to `manual`.
    required: false
    default: 'true'
  strict-check-on-push:
    description: |
      Differential ShellCheck performs full scans when running on a `push` event, but the Action fails only when new defects are added.
      This option allows overwriting this behavior. Hence when `strict-check-on-push` is set to `true` it will fail when any defect is discovered.
    required: false
    default: 'false'

  external-sources:
    description: |
      Enable following of source statements even when the file is not specified as input. By default, shellcheck will only follow files specified on the command-line (plus /dev/null).
      This option allows following any file the script may source. This option may also be enabled using external-sources=true in .shellcheckrc. This flag takes precedence.
    default: 'true'
    required: false
  severity:
    description: Specify minimum severity of errors to consider. Valid values in order of severity are error, warning, info and style. The default is style.
    default: style
    required: false

  scan-directory:
    description: Directory to scan. If not specified, the root directory is scanned.
    default: ''
    required: false
  exclude-path:
    description: List of paths excluded from ShellCheck scanning.
    default: ''
    required: false
  include-path:
    description: List of paths to files that will be scanned by ShellCheck.
    default: ''
    required: false

  token:
    description: GitHub TOKEN used to upload SARIF data.
    required: false
