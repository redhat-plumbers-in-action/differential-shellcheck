# Contributing

We would like to ask all contributors to follow the following guidelines when posting a GitHub Pull Request or filing a GitHub Issue.

## Filing Issues

* We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck/issues) **exclusively** for tracking **bugs** and **feature** **requests**. If you are looking for help, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck/discussions).
* Please include an explanation how to reproduce the issue you are pointing out.

Following these guidelines makes it easier for us to process your issue, and ensures we won't close your issue right-away for being misfiled.

## Security vulnerability reports

See [reporting of security vulnerabilities](SECURITY.md).

## Posting Pull Requests

* Make sure to post PRs only relative to a recent tip of the `main` branch.
* Make sure to run the test suite locally, before posting your PR. We use a CI system, meaning we don't even look at your PR if the build and tests don't pass.
* When submitting PR including new features, the PR should also include tests of given feature.

## Final Words

We'd like to apologize in advance if we are not able to process and reply to your issue or PR right-away. We have a lot of work to do, but we are trying our best!

Thank you very much for your contributions!
